  title: "Graduate Research Assistant"
  company: "Stanford University"
  supervisor: "Dr. Barbara Engelhardt"
  location: "Stanford, CA"
  description: "Developed an end-to-end pipeline for training and evaluation of deep learning models. Designed spatialâ€“temporal Transformer architectures for modeling CAR T cell behavior. Achieved 98%  accuracy and 20x improvement over an LSTM baseline on 165K+ patch embeddings. Scaled training across four NVIDIA A30 GPUs, reducing runtime from 8 hours to 2 hours."
